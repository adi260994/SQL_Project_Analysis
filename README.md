# SQL_Project_Analysis
SQL project to analyze online music store data

Through SQL queries and data manipulation, we aim to gain insights into various aspects of the music store's operations. This includes analyzing sales data to identify popular genres, top-selling artists, and customer purchasing patterns. We also explore inventory management by examining stock levels, product popularity, and identifying potential areas for improvement. The project involves writing SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data, and presenting the findings in a clear and concise manner.
